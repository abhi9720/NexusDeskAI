## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
-   `npm` or `yarn`

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/taskflow-ai.git
    cd taskflow-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your Gemini API Key:**
    -   Obtain a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    -   The application is configured to use the API key from `process.env.API_KEY`. You can manage this through your development environment or by adding it directly in the application's settings UI after launch.

### Running the Application

-   **For Web Development (Vite):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the application in your browser. Note that desktop-specific features like local file storage will be unavailable.

-   **For Desktop (Electron):**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run electron
    ```
    This will build the React app and then launch it in an Electron window, enabling all desktop features.
